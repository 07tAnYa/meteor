title: Migrating to Meteor 2.6.1
description: How to migrate your application to Meteor 2.6.1.
---

Meteor 2.6.1 introduce the new `accounts-2fa` package and also support to TailwindCSS 3.x incorporating `juliancwirko:postcss` minifier code to core as `minifier-css-postcss`. For a complete breakdown of the changes, please refer to the [changelog](http://docs.meteor.com/changelog.html).

The above being said, there are a few items that you should do to have the latest CSS minifier in your project.

<h3 id="new-css-minifier">CSS Minifier with PostCSS</h3>

If you are using `juliancwirko:postcss` as your PostCSS CSS Minifier and you want to use the latest Minifier for PostCSS you should use the new core package: `minifier-css-postcss` instead. 

If you want to use TailwindCSS 3.x you must use the new core package to insure Tailwind JIT working properly. 

Steps to replace the package:
  - `meteor remove juliancwirko:postcss`
  - `meteor add minifier-css-postcss`

After replacing the package with the commands above TailwindCSS 3.x should work fine with Meteor 2.6.1. 

Please read the [Tailwind Official migration guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide) to make sure you had applied the changes required by TailwindCSS itself.

<h3 id="2fa">Accounts 2FA</h3>

`accounts-2fa` is a new package that enables two-factor authentication for `accounts-password` and `accounts-passwordless`. 

There are no required changes to your application in any case, but if you want to provide 2FA for your users, and you are already using `accounts-password` or `accounts-passwordless` you can start using the new functions provided from 2FA package, read more in the [docs](https://docs.meteor.com/packages/accounts-2fa.html).
