description: Documentation of Meteor's `accounts-2fa` package.
---

This package allows you to provide a way for your users to enable 2FA on their accounts, using an authenticator app such as Google Authenticator, or 1Password. When the user is logged in on your app, they will be able to generate a new QR code and read this code on the app they prefer. After that, they'll start receiving their codes. Then, they can finish enabling 2FA on your app, and every time they try to log in to your app, you can redirect them to a place where they can provide a code they received from the authenticator.

This package uses [node-2fa](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-2fa) which works on top of [notp](https://github.com/guyht/notp), **that** implements TOTP ([RFC 6238](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6238.txt)) (the Authenticator standard), which is based on HOTP ([RFC 4226](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4226.txt)) to provide codes that are exactly compatible with all other Authenticator apps and services that use them.

> This package is meant to be used with `accounts-password`, so if you don't have `account-password` in your project, you'll need to add it. In the future, we want to enable the use of this package with other login methods, like `accounts-passwordless` or our oauth methods (Google, GitHub, etc...).

<h3 id="activating-2fa">Activating 2FA</h3>

The first step, in order to enable 2FA, is to generate a QR code so that the user can scan it in an authenticator app and start receiving codes.

{% apibox "Accounts.generate2faActivationQrCode" "module":"accounts-base" %}

Receives an `appName` which is the name of your app that will show up when the user scans the QR code. Also, a callback called with a QR code in SVG format on success or a single `Error` argument
on failure.

On success, this function will also add an object to the logged user containing the QR secret:

```js
twoFactorAuthetication: {
  secret: "***"
}
``` 

Here it's an example on how to call this function:

```js
import { Buffer } from "buffer";
import { Accounts } from 'meteor/accounts-base';

--
  
const [qrCode, setQrCode] = useState(null);

--
  
<button
  onClick={() => {
    Accounts.generate2faActivationQrCode((err, svg) => {
      if (err) {console.error("...", err);return;}
      /*
        the svg can be converted to base64, then be used like: 
         <img 
            width="200"
            src={`data:image/svg+xml;base64,${qrCode}`}
         />
      */
      setQrCode(Buffer.from(svg).toString('base64'));
    })
  }}
>
  Generate a new code
</button>
```


At this point, the 2FA won't be activated just yet. Now that the user has access to the codes generated by their authenticator app, you can call the function `Accounts.enableUser2fa`:

{% apibox "Accounts.enableUser2fa" "module":"accounts-base" %}

It should be called with a code that the users will receive from the authenticator app once they read the QR code. The callback is called with a single `Error` argument on failure. If the code provided is correct, a `type` will be added to the user's `twoFactorAuthentication` object and now 2FA is considered enabled:

```js
twoFactorAuthetication: {
  type: "otp",
  secret: "***",
}
```

<h3 id="log-in-with-2fa">Log in with 2FA</h3>

Now that you have a way to allow your users to enable 2FA on their accounts, you can create a login flow based on that.

To verify whether or not a user has 2FA enabled, you can call the function `Accounts.has2faEnabled`:

{% apibox "Accounts.has2faEnabled" "module":"accounts-base" %}

With this function, you can check whether or not the user has 2FA enabled, and based on this information, you can directly call `Meteor.loginWithPassword` if the 2FA is not enabled, or redirect the user to a place where they can provide a code, in case they do have 2FA enabled.

A way of using it would be:

```js
<button 
  onClick={() => {
    Accounts.has2faEnabled(username, (err, isEnabled) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error("Error verifying if user has 2fa enabled", err);
        return;
      }

      if (isEnabled) {
        // send user to a page or show a component 
        // where they can provide a 2FA code
        setShouldAskCode(true);
        return;
      }
      // Normal login when they don't have 2FA enabled.
      Meteor.loginWithPassword(username, password, error => {
        if (error) {
          console.error("Error trying to log in (user without 2fa)", error);
        }
      });
    });
  }
}>
  Login
</button>
```

If the user has 2FA enabled, and you try to use the function `Meteor.loginWithPassword`, the login will fail, as the user should provide a code to access the app.

The function you will need to call now to allow the user to login is `Meteor.loginWithPasswordAnd2faCode`:

{% apibox "Meteor.loginWithPasswordAnd2faCode" %}

Now you will be able to receive a code from the user and this function will verify if the code is valid. If it is, the user will be logged in.

So the call of this function should look something like this:

```js
<button onClick={() => {
  Meteor.loginWithPasswordAnd2faCode(username, password, code,error => {
    if (error) {
      console.error("Error trying to log in (user with 2fa)", error);
    }
  })}
}>
  Validate and log in
</button>
```

<h3 id="disabling-2fa">Disabling 2FA</h3>

To disable 2FA for a user use this method: 

{% apibox "Accounts.disableUser2fa" "module":"accounts-base" %}

To call this function the user must be already logged in.
